# Empyrean News

A take-home mobile app project that interacts with a mock API server. Built with SwiftUI, this app demonstrates login authentication, fetching and displaying posts, user and comment information, as well as local data handling and error resilience.


## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Login with JWT authentication
- 📃 Display list of posts after login
- 👤 Show author details for each post
- 💬 View post details, comments, and author info
- ❤️ Favorite/unfavorite items
- 🧭 Smooth navigation and screen transitions
- 🔄 Loading & error states with retry handling


## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Language:** Swift
- **UI Framework:** SwiftUI
- **Architecture:** MVVM
- **Networking:** URLSession
- **Persistence:** Core Data (for favorites)


## 📱 How to Run

1. Clone the repo  
2. Install and start the mock API server (see below)  
3. Open the `.xcodeproj` or `.xcworkspace` file in Xcode  
4. Build and run on iOS Simulator or physical device (iOS 16+)

## ✅ Login Credentials

Use these credentials to log in:

```plaintext
username: test
password: password123
```


## 🖥️ How to Run the Mock API Server

This project uses a mock API server to simulate backend functionality including authentication, fetching posts, users, and comments.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14 or later)  
- npm (Node package manager)  

### Installation

 Navigate to the folder called MockServer within the project submission folder in your terminal, then run:

 ```bash
 npm install
 npm start
 ```

## ⚖️ Assumptions & Tradeoffs
- The app assumes a stable internet connection except when chaos mode simulates errors
- Only one user will use this app (no multi-user support)
- Items, users, comments will remain a manageable size and will not increase
- Mock API responses are always consistent and follow the expected data format
- Chose simplicity over extensive error handling for some API failures to save time

## ⏳ What I’d Improve With More Time
- Add comprehensive unit tests and UI tests
- Add accessibility and localization features
- Add smooth animations and visual polish
